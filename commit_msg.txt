feat(backend): implement transactional service layer and agent tools

Implemented Features:
- Async database connection pool with asyncpg
- Transactional business logic (assign/remove/cancel operations)
- Consequence calculation for LangGraph decision-making
- Atomic audit logging within transactions
- Debug REST endpoints for testing

Core Modules (backend/app/core/):
- supabase_client.py: Connection pool management
- db.py: Low-level query helpers with transaction support
- consequences.py: Trip consequence calculator for agent
- audit.py: Transactional audit logging
- service.py: Business logic (assign/remove/cancel)
- tools.py: LangGraph tool exports

API Routes:
- debug.py: Debug endpoints

Tests:
- test_core_service.py: 10 comprehensive tests, all passing

Technical Highlights:
- asyncpg date object handling for PostgreSQL DATE columns
- Atomic transactions with automatic rollback on errors
- Schema corrections (user_id not employee_id, created_at not logged_at)
- Connection pool with SSL support and graceful shutdown
- Lifespan events for pool initialization/cleanup

Verification:
- All 10 tests passing
- Backend server starts successfully with pool initialization
- Debug endpoints return correct data for trips 1 and 2
- Transaction atomicity verified in tests
- Audit logs created correctly within transactions

Ready for Day 4: LangGraph agent integration
